# rehearse [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/qwoodmansee/rehearse.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/qwoodmansee/rehearse)


rehearse is an iOS/Android application used to practice difficult pieces of music to recordings, allowing users to speed up or slow down recordings and set practice points and loops. With an emphasis on a user-friendly experience, rehearse allows users to simply log in to their Google account and link to a Google Drive folder to source the audio and sheet music for their practice needs. If you lead an ensemble, you can set up one shared Google Drive for all your students to use. Alternatively, if you are a student, you can create your own Google Drive just for the songs you know you need to practice.

## Download

rehearse is currently under active development in an extremely early stage. Once core features are complete, you'll be able to find rehearse on the App Store and Play Store. Be sure to keep an eye on the repository for updates!

## Running Locally
Rehearse was built using React Native on top of the [expo](https://expo.io/learn) toolset. You'll need an Android Simulator (we recommend downloading [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)) and/or an iOS Simulator (we recommend installing [XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/)), but otherwise running the app locally is simple:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/qwoodmansee/rehearse.git
cd rehearse
expo start
```

## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change. All code is required to be tested in a dedicated file, and all lint rules are strongly enforced for code style consistency. Standalone commits with details messages are always appreciated.
